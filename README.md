# WorkforceWellnessAnalyzer
**Project Overview:** This project focuses on addressing absenteeism at a company during regular working hours. Workplace absenteeism often stems from several key factors, such as high competitiveness, unachievable business goals, and the elevated risk of unemployment. These issues increase pressure on employees, which can lead to temporary incapacity to fulfill their regular working hours.

The primary objective of this project is to analyze employee absenteeism and explore whether individuals with specific characteristics are more likely to be absent from work. Furthermore, we aim to predict how many working hours an employee could potentially be away from work based on various factors.

# Key Problem Areas Addressed:

High workplace competitiveness.
Unrealistic business goals.
Increased job insecurity, leading to stress and absenteeism.

**Project Approach:** To tackle the issue of absenteeism, I have employed a data-driven approach using Python and Pandas for data preprocessing, and Tableau for data visualization. The analysis focuses on identifying factors that influence absenteeism, such as:

**Distance from Workplace:** Examining how far employees live from their workplace.
**Family Responsibilities:** Considering the number of children and pets employees have.
**Education Level:** Investigating whether having higher education correlates with absenteeism.
**Visualizations:** I have plotted various factors that affect absenteeism using Tableau to gain deeper insights into patterns and trends. This visualization allows for a clearer understanding of how each factor contributes to absenteeism in the workplace.

# How This Project Helps Your organisation:

**Data-Driven Decisions:** By understanding the key factors contributing to absenteeism, the organisation can make informed decisions to address these issues.
**Workforce Planning:** This project helps predict how many hours employees might be away from work, aiding in more efficient workforce planning and resource allocation.
**Employee Well-Being:** Identifying stressors such as commuting distance, family responsibilities, and education level can help the company implement supportive measures to reduce absenteeism.
**Improved Productivity:** With a better understanding of absenteeism trends, the organisation can take proactive steps to improve employee attendance, ultimately enhancing productivity.
